    "\n",
    "The essential functions to facilitate the development of the lunar lander environment are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **get_velocity**: Returns an array representing the x and y velocities of the lander, each within the range $[0, 60]$.\n",
    "- **get_angle**: Returns a scalar representing the angle of the lander, ranging from $[0, 359]$ degrees.\n",
    "- **get_position**: Returns an array with the x and y positions of the lander, each ranging from $[0, 100]$.\n",
    "- **get_landing_zone**: Returns an array with the x and y coordinates of the landing zone, each ranging from $[1, 100]$.\n",
    "- **get_fuel**: Returns a scalar indicating the remaining amount of fuel, starting at $100$ and within the range $[0, 100]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions are provided as placeholders for this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Lunar Landar](lunar_landar.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the provided functions will be used to **structure the reward signal** based on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Crash Condition**: The lander will crash if it touches the ground with a ``y_velocity < -3`` (downward velocity greater than three).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Crash Condition**: The lander will crash if it touches the ground with an ``x_velocity < -10`` or ``x_velocity > 10`` (horizontal speed exceeding 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Crash Condition**: The lander will crash if it touches the ground and the angle is such that ``5 < angle < 355`` (the angle deviates more than 5 degrees from vertical).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Crash Condition**: The lander will crash if it has not yet landed and ``fuel <= 0`` (the fuel runs out).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fuel Efficiency**: Minimizing fuel consumption is preferred, as MST aims to save money on fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Landing Zone**: The lander must land within the designated landing zone. It will crash if it touches the ground and the ``x_position`` is not within the ``landing_zone`` (the lander lands outside the designated zone).\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the methods below to develop the lunar lander environment based on these criteria."

    "\n",
    "Designing an optimal reward function can be complex, and defining what constitutes the \"best\" reward function is often ambiguous. Instead of relying on quantitative metrics, evaluate the reward function qualitatively. We provide a series of test cases below, illustrating transitions and explaining the behavior of a sample reward function. \n",

Although the final stages of the capstone will use a standardized lunar lander environment implementation, this notebook focuses on gaining experience with environment and reward function design."
